# Educational-Portal---Connecting-Students-with-experts
We are building an advanced educational platform using Python and Django to connect students with industry experts for real-time learning and mentorship. As a Senior Python Django Developer, you will be responsible for developing the backend infrastructure, implementing API integrations, and ensuring the platformâ€™s scalability on Amazon Web Services. This project leverages the power of Python, Django, and AI to provide students with interactive sessions, progress tracking, and personalized learning experiences. 
==================
To build an advanced educational platform using Python, Django, and AI to connect students with industry experts for real-time learning and mentorship, we'll break the project into several key components. Below is an example Python/Django project structure along with the key features to be implemented, such as:

    Student-Expert Matching: AI-driven recommendation system.
    Real-Time Learning: Use WebSockets or a similar technology for live sessions.
    Progress Tracking: Store and track students' progress over time.
    Scalability on AWS: Deployment and scalability setup for AWS.

Step-by-Step Guide
Prerequisites:

    Python 3.x
    Django (For Backend)
    Channels (For WebSockets support)
    Celery (For background tasks like progress tracking or scheduling)
    Django Rest Framework (For APIs)
    PostgreSQL (Or any other relational database)
    AWS EC2, RDS (For deployment and scalability)
    Redis (For Celery and caching)

Installation and Setup

First, ensure you have the required libraries:

pip install django channels djangorestframework celery psycopg2 boto3

Step 1: Django Project Setup

Start by setting up a new Django project:

django-admin startproject edu_platform
cd edu_platform

Now, create an app for the core functionality of the platform (like users, mentors, sessions):

python manage.py startapp core

Add the app to your INSTALLED_APPS in edu_platform/settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other apps
    'core',
    'rest_framework',
    'channels',
]

Step 2: Define Models for Users, Mentors, and Sessions

In core/models.py, define the models for students, mentors, and sessions.

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Mentor(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    expertise = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    biography = models.TextField()
    availability = models.JSONField()  # List of available time slots

    def __str__(self):
        return self.user.username


class Student(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    interests = models.JSONField()  # Student's learning preferences
    progress = models.JSONField()  # Tracking progress as a dictionary

    def __str__(self):
        return self.user.username


class Session(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    mentor = models.ForeignKey(Mentor, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    scheduled_at = models.DateTimeField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=[('scheduled', 'Scheduled'), ('completed', 'Completed')])
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Session between {self.student} and {self.mentor} on {self.scheduled_at}"

Step 3: AI-Based Student-Mentor Matching

Next, you can implement an AI-based recommendation system to match students with mentors. You can use a simple cosine similarity approach based on student preferences and mentor expertise. This would involve the following steps:

    Get the interests of the student and the expertise of the mentor.
    Use natural language processing (NLP) to calculate similarity between the two.

You can integrate scikit-learn for the AI part.

Install the required packages:

pip install scikit-learn nltk

Now, create a helper function for matching in core/utils.py:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def get_mentor_match(student_interests, mentors):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

    # Combining student interests and mentor expertise for comparison
    mentor_expertise = [mentor.expertise for mentor in mentors]
    all_text = student_interests + mentor_expertise
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(all_text)

    cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:]).flatten()
    
    # Finding the best match
    best_match_index = cosine_similarities.argmax()
    return mentors[best_match_index]

Step 4: Real-Time Learning (WebSockets)

To facilitate real-time learning between students and mentors, you can use Django Channels, which extends Django to handle WebSockets.

First, install channels:

pip install channels

Set up the WebSocket connection in edu_platform/settings.py:

ASGI_APPLICATION = 'edu_platform.routing.application'

Create a routing.py file inside the project directory:

from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack
from core import consumers

application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
    "websocket": AuthMiddlewareStack(
        URLRouter([
            path("ws/lesson/<int:session_id>/", consumers.LessonConsumer.as_asgi()),
        ])
    ),
})

Now, create a consumer in core/consumers.py to handle the real-time communication:

import json
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class LessonConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        self.session_id = self.scope['url_route']['kwargs']['session_id']
        # Join room group
        self.room_group_name = f"lesson_{self.session_id}"
        await self.channel_layer.group_add(
            self.room_group_name,
            self.channel_name
        )
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Leave room group
        await self.channel_layer.group_discard(
            self.room_group_name,
            self.channel_name
        )

    # Receive message from WebSocket
    async def receive(self, text_data):
        text_data_json = json.loads(text_data)
        message = text_data_json['message']

        # Send message to room group
        await self.channel_layer.group_send(
            self.room_group_name,
            {
                'type': 'chat_message',
                'message': message
            }
        )

    # Receive message from room group
    async def chat_message(self, event):
        message = event['message']

        # Send message to WebSocket
        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({
            'message': message
        }))

In your Django settings, ensure the CHANNEL_LAYERS are configured:

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
        'CONFIG': {
            "hosts": [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
        },
    },
}

Step 5: API for Session Creation and Progress Tracking

You will need to implement REST APIs for handling session creation, student progress tracking, etc.

from rest_framework import serializers, viewsets
from .models import Student, Mentor, Session

class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = '__all__'


class MentorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Mentor
        fields = '__all__'


class SessionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Session
        fields = '__all__'


class StudentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Student.objects.all()
    serializer_class = StudentSerializer


class MentorViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Mentor.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MentorSerializer


class SessionViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Session.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SessionSerializer

Add these to edu_platform/urls.py:

from django.urls import include, path
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from core.views import StudentViewSet, MentorViewSet, SessionViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'students', StudentViewSet)
router.register(r'mentors', MentorViewSet)
router.register(r'sessions', SessionViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', include(router.urls)),
]

Step 6: Deployment and Scalability on AWS

    Deploy to AWS EC2: Set up an EC2 instance, install dependencies (Python, Redis, etc.), and deploy the Django app using Nginx and Gunicorn.

    Database on AWS RDS: Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to scale the database.

    Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing: Use AWS Auto Scaling Groups and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to handle traffic efficiently.

    Celery for Background Tasks: Integrate Celery for background tasks like progress tracking and notifications.

Conclusion

This framework gives you a strong starting point for building a scalable and AI-driven educational platform. With Django, Channels for real-time communication, and AI for student-mentor matching, you can offer personalized learning experiences while ensuring the platform is highly scalable on AWS.
